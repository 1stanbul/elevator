Windows UAC elevation that just works.

Description
-----------

This module is a thin wrapper around the awesome [elevate.exe utility by kliu](http://code.kliu.org/misc/elevate/), which is a small C open source application with x64 and ia32 support that just works.

This module doesn't make use of NodeJS C/C++ bindings and instead relies on executing the `.exe` file direcly in a way that is [electron](http://electron.atom.io) friendly even when the application is packaged in an `asar` archive.

Of course, this means that this NodeJS module is subjected to the Windows versions and architectures such supports. Windows Vista (or newer) is required.

Installation
------------

Install `elevator` by running:

```sh
$ npm install --save elevator
```
